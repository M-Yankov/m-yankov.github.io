        This is a continuation of the previous article <a href="/articles/the-results-so-far.html" target="_blank">
        the results so far</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        5 months after writing the previous article, I've put effort to add UI, to be more usable.
        Decided to use <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui" target="_blank"> MAUI .NET</a>, but as much
        I go deeper in using this technology stack, I realized that it still not fully production-ready. The examples
        from documentation are very common and it's difficult to apply them in your project. The missing functionalities are
        drag and drop files from desktop into a browse file input. Most of modern websites have such functionality, but MAUI
        doesn't. <b>The range slider:</b> this is the component I want to use, but it turns out such component is not developed
        in the .MAUI framework (<i>but it exist for WinUI3 SDK</i>). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Is it so hard to have a horizontal line with to sliders making a range and reporting where a slider was moved by the user?
        Well, no. Let's make it from scratch. The plan is to have two rectangles (<i>just to make it work, later the shape will be refined</i>)
        placed on a horizontal line (again rectangle) and move them on X axis. Left rectangle will be initially placed at 0% and
        right rectangle will be placed at 100% on the line. The space between sliders will be filled with some color.
        Of course additional calculations should be made to place sliders correctly, for example extracting/adding the width of the slider.
        Other consideration is to limit their movement to not cross each other.
        That calculations are not hard, but the problem again come unexpectedly from the MAUI framework. When moving a slider
        fast or leave the dragging area, the slider is dropped at last location without rise an event that the object has been released 
        from dragging. Then how to show on the UI a message like: <i>Hey user, you've dropped the object, want to try again.</i>, instead
        nothing happens. The decision was to live with that for now (<i>until a miracle happens and MAUI team decides to add fixes.</i> ) and
        continue forward. For my luck other components planned by my design drawings worked well, the collapse sections, loading indicators
        waiting for async operations and progress bars.   
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the stages of development was to decide whether to use MVVM approach (difficult to apply), it's idea is to separate UI
        components from the code. It works with a model binder object which the .xaml files are listening for changes 
        that was previously configured. The code updates the object which reflects the changes in the UI. The other approach is the code-behind
        to contain reference to components (Button, Label, Slider...) and manipulate directly them. <pre>this.Button.Enabled = false</pre>. The
        model binder approach is good, but at some time there is a need to put logic there and it no longer remains "model". The current 
        situation is such that both approaches are applied on different places.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's time to share a social aspect of my life that the integration of UI come in a little rush moment for me. I was looking for a job and
        my idea was to present at interviews my project. Telemetry Exporter wasn't 100% ready, but I mention it at every interview. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Near May the project was ready for use as beta version 0.0.1. Since I was the main user, after each usage I was discovering little issues
        and major bugs that need a fix. Little improvements of trace widget make it look very good on videos changing the path color and size of
        the path itself and the red dot. The pace widget didn't report correct data and calculations were fixed in 0.0.2. Other small issues are missing
        frames. One of them are for sure at the end of exporting, they are just missing. Another issues that random frames are missing in the
        sequence. For now I'm sure it happens when multiple widgets are selected for export, meaning that the workaround is to export one by one.
        Other workaround is to use cmd terminal with <i>copy</i> command: <pre>> copy frame_000031 frame 000032</pre> assuming the 32 is the missing
        frame. The hack of copying the previous frame could show incorrect results. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Compared to <i>Gramin Virb</i> I'm for 100% more satisfied that the project serves the purpose designed for and it works. The open-source
        strategy will give an opportunity to extends current functionality fix bugs and show transparency that personal data is not used by the
        code. I received a question whether the app could export the frames as a <b>video</b>. Everything is possible, but for now it won't serve
        this functionality, because another program <i>ffmpeg</i> with correct parameters can combine the frames into a video. Main purpose for now
        is the frames to be used in external video editor like Davinci Resolve.
        Telemetry Exporter consist of two pages (views), one to select a <i>.fit</i> file from Garmin and the second view is automatically loaded
        with preview elevation and other setting for export.
    </p>
    <p>
        The future plans for developing the project is to stabilize the core logic of generating and exporting frames. As soon as possible the issues
        get fixed, the better, but it may require time. It's good opportunity, because next months I will not participate in any race event, no more travels
        meaning I will not worry for packing backpacks, wake-up early and organize other stuff all this gives me time to work on the issues.
        After fixing all the bugs, then its time for adding more widgets, I think this will attract more users.
        I'm not satisfied with MAUI as a framework. I was really surprised form the issues I encountered and found that most of them are known bugs,
        some of them have workarounds, but other are just waiting for fix a.k.a. miracle.
        There are several projects that may replace MAUI: Uno, Avalonia UI, Flutter. But for each of them I heard bad things. From another side I
        really keen ot use Electron JS, but I'm not sure how a JS code will work with C# library. I'm not afraid of JS code, contrary sometimes its
        more flexible than C#.
