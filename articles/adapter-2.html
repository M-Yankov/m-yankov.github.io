    <h3>
        Lets start with the problem:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Its March. The month of celebration of Baba Marta. Along with warming weather, we exchange <i>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martenitsa" target="_blank">martenitsi</a></i> for good fortune
        and health.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the "stupid" advertisements grabbed my attention offering a red white band just like a martenitsa
        decoration pattern. Excellent, take my money, (it was like â‚¬5). But the problem appeared: 
        <b> it won't fit </b> on my Garmin Fenix 6 PRO watch. Whyyyyy? Its soo complicated ... The wrist band is
        22mm wide, but the watch has a 26mm lug width. I have to find an adapter to fit it. I think the problem comes
        from the Marketing department of the shop (they are large telecommunications company) that decided to sell
        that wrist band, without checking if it fits any of the watches. Actually they don't sale Garmin, because
        this watches are supposed to be used for sports, not as a style accessory where more client want to be stylish.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course the adapter exists. It simple converts the 22mm band to 26mm lug width. For my luck, I found it
        locally offered from someone from the Facebook groups.
    </p>
    <p>
       Example of the adapter:
       <img src="./images/Garmin_Fenix_Adapter_22_to_26.jpg" alt="Garmin adapter example" width="300"> 
    </p>
    <p>
        And the result is:
        <img src="./images/Garmin_Fenix_Adapter_22_to_26_reality.jpg" alt="Garmin adapter result" width="300">
    </p>
    <p>
        Explaining the image: It is the back-side of the watch, the martenitsa ends with a white connectors 22mm
        for a watch. In my case they are connected to the orange adapter, which is connected to the watch 26mm. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course the adapter's color didn't match the watch either the wrist band colors, but I was in a hurry and
        didn't want to wait a half month for an adapter with better: color white, red or black.
