        Last months I had more time for me, because I didn't participate in events, competitions, didn't go on travels. So I decided
        to make a brain rest time by playing games a lot. Apex Legends in the perfect example where I spend late nights playing it.
        The game is not bad, contrary - it is very good and it is very addictive. It's like the beers when you say "It will be one 
        beer only, don't worry" and you end up drinking 5-6 beers. The thing like "one beer only" never exists. The game is the same,
        "just one more match", "just one more match" and after 20 played matches its 3:00AM. Ohh no... again.<br/>
        Every aspect of the game is very good, the graphics, the sound, the gameplay, the characters, the weapons, the map and
        playing all of this makes me relaxed because my brain is almost off. Most of the moves are muscle memory and if there is
        something new, it requires learned very quickly. In the same time the brain rests the body starts lacking of sleep. I want to
        be a morning person, where I get up at 6:00 clock, go for a 5km run, make a coffee and start work relaxed at 8:00 AM.
        Unfortunately that became a dream. <br/>
        More tasks occupied my mind, books, movies, responsibilities, the project etc. , but only to delay all of them, because
        they are the "have to" do tasks, not "I want to". Consequently I started to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination" target="_parent">
        procrastinate</a>, that may sound a very bad disease, but I call it a higher level of laziness. <br/>
        After attending a training for team efficiency, I analyzed behavior of other people and I see that I overthink a lot of things, when
        others just act. This is called "reaction" - do things by instinct. But form the other side the "pro-active" is a behavior
        where a person thinks about the situation and the makes its accurate decision. That training proves my theory that people are making
        a lot of mistakes while on rush, like me where for a given time I had to make quick and wrong decisions also influenced
        by others. My comfort zone is 80% thinking and 20% acting. <i>(Don't think for the Sports, moving is not the same as acting)</i>
        or waiting for the perfect moment for an action. Any other attempt of an unplanned action is making me look like a fool just
        like the last exercise from the training where I didn't read the instructions carefully. <br/>
        Not only at the training, but watching other's people behavior, I see that some of them just do the things without using the
        brain. The very good example is people who talk public in interviews and they are making incoherent speech which sound strange
        and turns out that this person missed some grades in school or have very poop dictionary of wording (example Bojinov). <br/> 
        However, I think I should find the balance and act more in some situations, like taking an initiative for something or react
        quickly and not being scared of other's approval. <br/>
        <b>The Autumn </b> yet another thing that increases my laziness. The leaves of trees are falling down, days are shorter, it gets
        dark sooner, the weather is cold and rainy. Not sure why love this period of the year pretending to have beautiful landscapes, but
        the nature just prepares for the cold weather as we the humans switching to the winter fashion clothes. <i>The Winter is coming</i>.
        It may sound very negative, but what else to say after the sunny days. I don't want to lie myself. In short November is no my month.<br/>
        The other toxic invected time consuming procrastination characteristic is watching trash content in social media. Even the content is
        useful or it is How-to videos, it is still a waste of time that I could spend on something else. <br/>  
        Now... March 2025, three month after stopped playing Apex Legends, (<i>Don't mind me wrong the game is good</i>) , I didn't feel any better, but replaced the gaming time with
        gym exercises. Several weeks of heavy training using the cycle machine, sweating a lot, sauna and limit the sweeteners in dining,
        I didn't lost any weight and still this didn't cure the laziness mood (I just want to sleep). Very soon I realized 
        that I push too much effort in exercises without giving a change my body to rest. After few days of doing nothing, the very
        next training I felt power and energy. As always the key here is the <strong>balance</strong> <br>
        The good part is that mood didn't affect my work, where I keep the interest of doing thing in the project.
