        This is a continuation of the previous article <a href="/articles/start-of-a-new-project.html" target="_blank">
        start a new project</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        So far the the answer of my efforts is <b>Yes. It's possible</b>. At this time writing this article the software
        solution represents a single C# file as a console application using the latest .NET Core version. Approximately
        1000 lines of code, it's ugly, but it works. Now it's should be enhanced refactored and add some UI (Web/Desktop)
        _Flutter is very popular, but on the other side MAUI in getting popular, knowing that is based on XAML (Xamarin)_.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently two main libraries are dependant of the solution: <a href="https://github.com/garmin/fit-csharp-sdk" 
        target="_blank">Garmin.Fit.Sdk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp" target="_blank">SkiaSharp</a>.
        <i>Garmin.Fit.Sdk</i> was recently published in nuget which perfectly matches my time of starting developing this 
        project. Its responsibility is to decode <i>Fit</i> files and retrieve the information like the speed, distance etc.
        The other package <i>SkiaSharp</i> is actually a C++ library, but it's porter for .NET as a layer which methods
        are working with C++ core APIs. It makes rendering of the images possible. Also it has <i>not terrible</i> 
        documentation and fiddle web page where the code can be tested before it gets into the project. However it is c++,
        but it's easy to find the relative method for .NET.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for the other difficulties, with a little math and using relative measurement it's possible. The route is drawn
        without much problems - it turns out it's not so hard. The complex images can be imported from Garmin installation
        files or other sources. The main images are build from scratch using basic shapes like lines, circles, rectangles.
        The rate of generating images <i>(FPS)</i> can be easily modified. It's just variable where its value can be
        provided from outside. However I not recommend more than 10 FPS. To render only certain part of the activity is
        still not tested, but as the previous statement, there are two variables <i>start/end</i> which can be configured.
