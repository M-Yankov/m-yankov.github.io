    <p>Continuation of <a href="/articles/the-usage.html" target="_blank">the usage</a> article related to Telemetry exporter.</p>
    <p>
        After an year and a half I bring a simple user interface in order to interact with the export logic. The current version of
        the app is 0.0.9. .NET MAUI was chosen as this technology is new and modern and it could be will on the top the of wave. 
        However, .MAUI have hidden traps that may lead to unpleasant experience using it and developing it. I think .NET MAUI 
        is more focused on mobile development and cross-platform usage. Despite of that, I only need it to work for windows and 
        <i>eventually for linux and Mac OS</i>. <br/>
        The app can be tested more easily on linux <i>containers may help here</i>, but for Mac OS, I need to have a Mac
        machine which I don't have and need to find somehow to be tested. <br/>
        There is no need Telemetry exporter to be available for mobile, because the main logic is to export frames which is time 
        consuming and it could drain the battery of the device. <br/>
        The only option for mobile is instead of making the export on the device, it could send a HTTP request, or trigger a
        function in the cloud to do the job. Now a consider it may cost money for cloud service, it also may require a database
        to track which device how many requests make in order to prevent abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
        Issue after issue I push forward the project, as of version 0.0.9 the last feature was adding option to export the frames
        in a folder. Compared  to the Zip export option, the folder export is easy for usage, because it doesn't need additional
        time to of waiting unzipping the file. Meaning that the telemetry data is ready for use. <br/>
        The zip archive is useful when exporting frames on one location (or different PC) and moving the archive somewhere else. <br/>
        Another major improvement was to separate the main logic into classes and models. The UI in different project where
        I try to keep only logic related to the user-interface. At first glance the main logic was in a the <i>Main</i> method
        of the Program.cs class with 2-3 helper classes. As in the previous articles I wanted to see whether the idea will work,
        that's why I didn't want to spend time on creating a high quality code. Now I regret this by a little, because the code is
        hard to be refactored, but not impossible. Last refactoring caused a lot of bugs like miscalculated distance, forgotten to
        consider different variables selected by the user. <br/>
        Still the main logic of exporting remained in a <i>do...while</i> loop. ( <i>I just wanted to utilize my knowledge of
        programming and put someday the do...while loop in usage </i> ) This may be removed as it is complicated and hardly to
        understand from people. <br/>

    <h4>People:</h4>
    <p>
        After creating several videos in youtube using the Telemetry exporter to generate the telemetry data,
        I realized that the app may have some potential. And I put more effort to make it easy for use, by adding a short
        video instructions, adding documentation for the usage. <br/>
        It didn't get thousands of views, but some people find it useful and comment it, <b>others used the link from the 
        description to download the app and make a request (issue in Github) for a feature or reported a bug!</b>. <br/>
        This means a lot for me, because people find a way to reach me somehow. <br/>
        I've ensured the app is very easy to be used by testing that it opens form an `.exe` file. It represents the build
        state of the app in release mode. But for it works, later I may consider to add an installer. <br/>
        <strong>
        The most important thing is that I will aim the app to remain free and open-source, so people can use it without
        any restrictions. Without needing any registration and need of internet connection with full transparency and possibility
        to use any older version if new version has undesired behavior or users complaining about something. Just like any popular
        open-source library. Bootstrap is a good example of this where the latest version has some bugs, but it the previous
        versions the problem is not present.
        </strong>

    <h4>Personality:</h4>
    <p>
        Looking back to the beginning of the article, I've written so many words, but <i>I'm firmly planted on the ground</i>
        realizing that a single developer could hardly beat a whole team of software engineers and QAs. Including that I want
        to use my free time for sports, social life with friends, reading books, watching movies, playing games this makes
        the things very hard. I mean to make this app popular and used by many people. <br/>
    </p>
    <h4>Widgets:</h4>
    <p>
        Also in the last months I received requests in Github. They were less than 5, but still making me happy that people reached me
        (<i>perhaps</i>) from the youtube video. Most of them are for a widget configuration or missing stats (power). Meaning that I
        should put more effort in extending the widget configurations, like change the colors, font, size etc. This will make future
        widgets more flexible. <strong>The most important thing is to make "Abstract widget factory".</strong> Example: the current widget
        for distance, represented by a two rectangles (one for the whole distance, one for the current distance) should be able to represent
        all stats like speed, power, elevation, heart rate etc. It only needs the two variables: <b>max</b> and <b>current</b> values.
        Max is constant value, while current is changing, but not exceed the max value. <br/>
        The sooner add this functionalities the better. <br/>
        The target for next months is added, widget functionalities.
